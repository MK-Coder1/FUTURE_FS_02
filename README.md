# Wanderlust

Wanderlust is an Airbnb-style web app built as a full-stack learning project. It focuses on core product flows like browsing listings, creating listings, reviews, favorites, and user authentication.

## What I Learned
- Building a full-stack app with Node.js, Express, and EJS.
- Designing REST-style routes and separating controllers, routes, and views.
- Handling authentication and sessions with Passport.js.
- Validating input with Joi and protecting routes with middleware.
- Uploading and storing images using Multer and Cloudinary.
- Working with MongoDB and Mongoose for models and relationships.
- Adding search, filters, sorting, and pagination for better UX.
- Integrating maps using Leaflet and OpenStreetMap.

## What I Built (What I Developed)
- Listing CRUD with image uploads and categories.
- Search, filter, and sort controls for listings.
- Favorites system for logged-in users.
- Reviews and ratings with access control.
- Flash messages and clean UI flow.
- Map preview on listing detail pages.

## What I Think (Reflections)
- Breaking features into small, testable steps reduced bugs.
- Middleware design made auth and permissions easier to manage.
- A consistent UI and clear routing made the app feel real.

## What I Gained
- Confidence in building and structuring a full-stack project.
- Better understanding of sessions, authentication, and security basics.
- Practical experience with third-party services (Cloudinary, Atlas).
- Stronger debugging and deployment readiness.

## Technology Used
- Node.js, Express
- EJS (templating), EJS-Mate (layouts)
- MongoDB, Mongoose
- Passport.js, express-session, connect-mongo
- Multer, Cloudinary
- Joi (validation)
- Leaflet, OpenStreetMap (map + geocoding)
- Bootstrap 5, Font Awesome

## Summary
Wanderlust helped me move from small exercises to a real-world, full-stack product. I learned how to design features end-to-end, connect UI with backend logic, and integrate databases and external services. This project reflects my growth in planning, building, and polishing a complete web application.
